Compositionality is very imoprtant.

Distributed partition: learn semantically-meaninful features independent of other features.

Deep learning: learning an internal representation. Good representation help solve other tasks.

How to disentangle representation into meaningful concepts?

## Backprop

## Debugging
Train on a small dataset: verify you can reach 0 training error

For visual udersttanding:
extra informattion needed, such as:
- 3rd
- physics
